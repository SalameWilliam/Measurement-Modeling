/*  This thread takes a socket and sends a matrix computation request
 *  This thread exists because we need to keep the inter-arrival rate
 *  constant and if we wait to receive an answer before sending a new request
 *  the inter-arrival rate will depend on the response time and makes the
 *  model computation difficult. We could have done it without a thread but
 *  this facilitates the response time data management as the thread waits for the
 *  response and puts it in a data array instead of ignoring it.
